//4.20 (Salary Calculator) Develop a Java application that determines the gross pay for each of
//        three employees. The company pays straight time for the first 40 hours worked by each employee
//        and time and a half for all hours worked in excess of 40. You’re given a list of the employees, their
//        number of hours worked last week and their hourly rates. Your program should input this information
//        for each employee, then determine and display the employee’s gross pay. Use class Scanner to
//        input the data.
